  "summary": "Analysis of 100 help-seeking posts from the r/lovable subreddit reveals widespread user frustration stemming primarily from persistent bugs, integration issues, and limitations in Lovable's functionality.  The most frequent problems involve 'Failed to save changes' errors, build errors, and issues connecting to Supabase.  Users express high frustration levels, with many reporting wasted credits and significant time lost due to unresolved problems.  The majority of issues are technical in nature, reflecting flaws in the platform's design and implementation, rather than simple user errors.",
